Some portions of Lima are useful for other projects too and split out to separate repos:

<!-- sorted by importance to end users -->
- <https://github.com/lima-vm/socket_vmnet>: vmnet.framework support for unmodified rootless QEMU
- <https://github.com/lima-vm/lima-actions>: run Lima on GitHub Actions
- <https://github.com/lima-vm/go-qcow2reader>: qcow2 reader for Go
- <https://github.com/lima-vm/sshocker>: ssh + reverse sshfs + port forwarder, in Docker-like CLI (predecessor of Lima)
- <https://github.com/lima-vm/alpine-lima>: Create an alpine based image for lima

See also <https://github.com/lima-vm> for other subprojects.

The maintainership of the subprojects corresponds to the [maintainership](../governance) of Lima itself.
