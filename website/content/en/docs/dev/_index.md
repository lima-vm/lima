## ðŸ“Œ Quick Start for Contributors

- **Explore the codebase**: Use [DeepWiki's Lima page](https://deepwiki.com/lima-vm/lima) to understand the structure and find references easily.
- **Check the project structure**: Key directories include `cmd/`, `pkg/`, and `website/`.
- **Follow the contributing guide**: Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup instructions.
- **Join the discussion**: Engage with the community via GitHub Issues or Discussions.

## ðŸ§  Tips for First-Time Contributors

- Donâ€™t be afraid to ask questions.
- Use `make` to build the project or run tests if you're exploring the CLI side.
