Welcome to the Lima Developer Guide!

If youâ€™re new and want to help with Lima, youâ€™re in the right place. Lima is a free tool that helps you run Linux virtual machines on macOS.

Hereâ€™s how you can get started:

## ðŸ“Œ Quick Start for Contributors

- **Learn about the code**: Visit [Lima on DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/lima-vm/lima) to see how things are set up.
- **Know the main folders**: Look inside `cmd/`, `pkg/`, and `website/`. These are important parts of the project.
- **Read the guide**: Follow the steps in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/lima-vm/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to set up everything.
- **Talk with others by joining the community**: You can ask questions or share your ideas on GitHub Issues or Discussions.

## ðŸ§  Tips for First-Time Contributors

- Start with small things: fix typos, improve docs, or make comments in code easier to understand.
- Donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re not sureâ€”just ask.
- Use `make` to test or build the project if you're working with the command line.

Weâ€™re happy youâ€™re here. Every little bit of contribution counts!
