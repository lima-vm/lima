| ⚡ Requirement | Lima >= 0.14, macOS >= 13.0 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|

"vz" option makes use of native virtualization support provided by macOS Virtualization.Framework.

"vz" has been the default driver for macOS hosts since Lima v1.0.

An example configuration (no need to be specified manually):
{{< tabpane text=true >}}
{{% tab header="CLI" %}}
```bash
limactl start --vm-type=vz
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="YAML" %}}
```yaml
vmType: "vz"

base:
- template:_images/ubuntu
- template:_default/mounts
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabpane >}}
### Caveats
- "vz" option is only supported on macOS 13 or above
- Virtualization.framework doesn't support running "intel guest on arm" and vice versa

### Known Issues
- "vz" doesn't support `legacyBIOS: true` option, so guest machine like `centos-stream` and `oraclelinux-8` will not work on Intel Mac.
- When running lima using "vz", `${LIMA_HOME}/<INSTANCE>/serial.log` will not contain kernel boot logs
- On Intel Mac with macOS prior to 13.5, Linux kernel v6.2 (used by Ubuntu 23.04, Fedora 38, etc.) is known to be unbootable on vz.
  kernel v6.3 and later should boot, as long as it is booted via GRUB.

  The issue is fixed in macOS 13.5.
