The following features are deprecated:

- CentOS 7 support
- Loading non-strict YAMLs (i.e., YAMLs with unknown properties)
- `limactl show-ssh` command (Use `ssh -F ~/.lima/default/ssh.config lima-default` instead)
- Ansible provisioning mode (Use `ansible-playbook playbook.yaml` after the start instead)
- `LIMA_SSH_PORT_FORWARDER` environment variable: deprecated in Lima v2.0, in favor of [the new "dual" port forwarder](../config/port.md) that mixes SSH and gRPC implementations.
