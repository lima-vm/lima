#   This will be shown to the user.

# Extra environment variables that will be loaded into the VM at start up.
# These variables are consumed by internal init scripts, and also added
# to /etc/environment.
# If you set any of "ftp_proxy", "http_proxy", "https_proxy", or "no_proxy", then
# Lima will automatically set an uppercase variant to the same value as well.
# 🟢 Builtin default: null
# env:
#   KEY: value

# Lima will override the proxy environment variables with values from the current process
# environment (the environment in effect when you run `limactl start`). It will automatically
# replace the strings "localhost" and "127.0.0.1" with the host gateway address from inside
# the VM, so it stays routable. Use of the process environment can be disabled by setting
# propagateProxyEnv to false.
# 🟢 Builtn default: true
propagateProxyEnv: null

# The host agent implements a DNS server that looks up host names on the host
# using the local system resolver. This means changing VPN and network settings
# are reflected automatically into the guest, including conditional forward,
# and mDNS lookup. By default only IPv4 addresses will be returned. IPv6 addresses
# can only work when using a vmnet network interface and the host has working
# IPv6 configured as well.
hostResolver:
  # 🟢 Builtin default: true
  enabled: null
  # 🟢 Builtin default: false
  ipv6: null
  # Static names can be defined here as an alternative to adding them to the hosts /etc/hosts.
  # Values can be either other hostnames, or IP addresses. The host.lima.internal name is
  # predefined to specify the gateway address to the host.
  # 🟢 Builtin default: null
  hosts:
    # guest.name: 127.1.1.1
    # host.name: host.lima.internal

# If useHostResolver is false, then the following rules apply for configuring dns:
# Explicitly set DNS addresses for qemu user-mode networking. By default qemu picks *one*
# nameserver from the host config and forwards all queries to this server. On macOS
# Lima adds the nameservers configured for the first host interface in service order,
# that has an IPv4 address, to the list. In case this still doesn't work (e.g. VPN
# setups), the servers can be specified here explicitly. If nameservers are specified
# here, then the configuration from network preferences will be ignored.
# 🟢 Builtin default: null
# dns:
# - 1.1.1.1
# - 1.0.0.1

# ===================================================================== #
# GLOBAL DEFAULTS AND OVERRIDES
# ===================================================================== #

# The builtin defaults can be changed globally by creating a $LIMA_HOME/_config/default.yaml
# file. It will be used by ALL instances under the same $LIMA_HOME, and it
# will be applied on each `limactl start`, so can affect instance restarts.

# A similar mechanism is $LIMA_HOME/_config/override.yaml, which will take
# precedence even over the settings in an instances lima.yaml file.
# It too applies to ALL instances under the same $LIMA_HOME, and is applied
# on each restart. It can be used to globally override settings, e.g. make
# the mount of the home directory writable.

# On each instance start the config settings are determined: If a value is
# not set in `lima.yaml`, then the `default.yaml` is used. If that file
# doesn't exist, or the value is not defined in the file, then the builtin
# default is used. If `override.yaml` exists and defines the value, then
# it overrides whatever has been chosen so far.

# For slices (e.g. `mounts`, `provision`) and maps (`env`) the entries are
# combined instead of replacing each other. Slices are produced from override
# settings, followed by lima.yaml, followed by defaults.yaml (but NOT from
# builtin defaults). Maps are produced starting with defaults.yaml values,
# overwriting with lima.yaml ones, overwriting with override.yaml.

# Exceptions:
# - `dns` will use the list from the highest priority file; they are not
#   combined. If override.yaml defines a list of `dns` entries, then the
#   settings in default.yaml and lima.yaml are ignored.
#
# - `mounts` will update the `writable` setting when 2 entries have the
#   same `location` value. For this reason they are processed in the opposite
#   order: starting with default, followed by lima, and then override.
#
# -`networks` will replace lower priority entries with the same `interface`
#   name with higher priority definitions. This does not apply if the
#  `interface` field is empty. `networks` are therefore also processed
#  in lowest to highest priority order.
