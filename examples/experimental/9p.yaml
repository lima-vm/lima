# ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ `template://experimental/9p` will be removed in Lima v1.0,
# as 9p will graduate from experimental and will be the default mount type for QEMU.
#
# For Lima v1.0 and later, use the following command instead:
# ```
# limactl create --vm-type=qemu template://default
# ```

# This template requires Lima v0.10.0 or later.
# On macOS hosts, QEMU needs to be v7.0.0 or later. Homebrew's QEMU v6.2.0_1 can be used too.
# This template is planned to be merged to default.yaml in Lima v1.0 (ETA: 2022 Q2).
images:
# Try to use release-yyyyMMdd image if available. Note that release-yyyyMMdd will be removed after several months.
