# Deploy faasd (which installs a bundled containerd).
#
# It can be accessed from the host by authenticating with faas-cli;
# the ports are already forwarded automatically by lima:
#
# Get the faas-cli:
# $ curl -sLS https://cli.openfaas.com | sh
#
# You can now log into your gateway:
# $ export OPENFAAS_URL=http://localhost:8080
# $ limactl shell faasd sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password | faas-cli login -u admin --password-stdin
# $
# $ faas-cli store deploy NodeInfo
#
# Deployed. 200 OK.
# URL: http://localhost:8080/function/nodeinfo
#
# This example requires Lima v0.7.0 or later.

# Image is set to focal (20.04 LTS) for long-term stability
images:
# Try to use release-yyyyMMdd image if available. Note that release-yyyyMMdd will be removed after several months.
