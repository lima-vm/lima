# Deploy kubernetes via k3s (which installs a bundled containerd).
#
# It can be accessed from the host by exporting the kubeconfig file;
# the ports are already forwarded automatically by lima:
#
# $ export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/kubeconfig.yaml
# $ limactl shell k3s sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml >$KUBECONFIG
# $ kubectl get no
# NAME       STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
# lima-k3s   Ready    control-plane,master   69s   v1.21.1+k3s1
#
# This example requires Lima v0.7.0 or later.

    The k3s kubeconfig file has not yet been created.
    Run "limactl shell k3s sudo journalctl -u k3s" to check the log.
    If that is still empty, check the bottom of the log at "/var/log/cloud-init-output.log".
