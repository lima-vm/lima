# Default values in this YAML file are specified by `null` instead of Lima's "builtin default" values,

# Explicitly set DNS addresses for qemu user-mode networking. By default, qemu picks *one*
# nameserver from the host config and forwards all queries to this server. On macOS
# Lima adds the nameservers configured for the first host interface in service order,
# that has an IPv4 address, to the list. In case this still doesn't work (e.g. VPN
# setups), the servers can be specified here explicitly. If nameservers are specified
# here, then the configuration from network preferences will be ignored.
# 🟢 Builtin default: []
# dns:
# - 1.1.1.1
# - 1.0.0.1

# Prefix to use for installing guest agent, and containerd with dependencies (if configured)
# 🟢 Builtin default: /usr/local
guestInstallPrefix: null

# When the "plain" mode is enabled:
# - the YAML properties for mounts, port forwarding, containerd, etc. will be ignored
# - guest agent will not be running
# - dependency packages like sshfs will not be installed into the VM
# User-specified provisioning scripts will be still executed.
# 🟢 Builtin default: false
plain: null

# When the "nestedVirtualization" feature is enabled:
# - Allows running a VM inside the guest VM.
# - The guest VM must configure QEMU with the `-cpu host` parameters to run a nested VM:
#   qemu-system-aarch64 -accel kvm -cpu host -M virt
# - Without specifying `-cpu host`, nested virtualization may fail with the error:
#   qemu-system-aarch64: kvm_init_vcpu: kvm_arch_init_vcpu failed (0): Invalid argument
# - Only supported on Apple M3 or later with `vmType: vz`.
# 🟢 Builtin default: false

# GLOBAL DEFAULTS AND OVERRIDES
# ===================================================================== #

# The builtin defaults can be changed globally by creating a $LIMA_HOME/_config/default.yaml
# file. It will be used by ALL instances under the same $LIMA_HOME, and it
# will be applied on each `limactl start`, so can affect instance restarts.

# A similar mechanism is $LIMA_HOME/_config/override.yaml, which will take
# precedence even over the settings in an instances lima.yaml file.
# It also applies to ALL instances under the same $LIMA_HOME, and is applied
# on each restart. It can be used to globally override settings, e.g. make
# the mount of the home directory writable.

# EXPERIMENTAL
# A third mechanism is $LIMA_HOME/_config/base.yaml. It is similar to
# `default.yaml` but will be merged during the `base` template embedding
# when the instance is created, and not on every start. It becomes part
# of the lima.yaml file.

# On each instance start the config settings are determined: If a value is
# not set in `lima.yaml`, then the `default.yaml` is used. If that file
# doesn't exist, or the value is not defined in the file, then the builtin
# default is used. If `override.yaml` exists and defines the value, then
# it overrides whatever has been chosen so far.

# For slices (e.g. `mounts`, `provision`) and maps (`env`) the entries are
# combined instead of replacing each other. Slices are produced from override
# settings, followed by lima.yaml, followed by default.yaml (but NOT from
# builtin defaults). Maps are produced starting with default.yaml values,
# overwriting with lima.yaml ones, overwriting with override.yaml.

# Exceptions:
# - `dns` will use the list from the highest priority file; they are not
#   combined. If override.yaml defines a list of `dns` entries, then the
#   settings in default.yaml and lima.yaml are ignored.
#
# - `mounts` will update the `writable` setting when 2 entries have the
#   same `location` value. For this reason they are processed in the opposite
#   order: starting with default, followed by lima, and then override.
#
# -`networks` will replace lower priority entries with the same `interface`
#   name with higher priority definitions. This does not apply if the
#  `interface` field is empty. `networks` are therefore also processed
#  in lowest to highest priority order.
