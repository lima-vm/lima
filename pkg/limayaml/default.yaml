# BASIC CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================== #

# Default values are specified by `null` instead of the builtin default value,
# so they can be overridden by the default.yaml mechanism documented at the
# end of this file.

# Arch: "default", "x86_64", "aarch64".
# Default: "default" (corresponds to the host architecture)
arch: null

# An image must support systemd and cloud-init.
# Ubuntu and Fedora are known to work.
# Default: none (must be specified)
images:
# Try to use a local image first.

  # SSHFS has an optional flag called 'follow_symlinks'. This allows mounts
  # to be properly resolved in the guest os and allow for access to the

# FURTHER ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================== #

firmware:
  # Use legacy BIOS instead of UEFI.
  # Default: false
  legacyBIOS: null

video:
  # QEMU display, e.g., "none", "cocoa", "sdl", "gtk".

# The instance can get routable IP addresses from the vmnet framework using
# https://github.com/lima-vm/vde_vmnet.
networks:
# Lima can manage daemons for networks defined in $LIMA_HOME/_config/networks.yaml
# automatically. Both vde_switch and vde_vmnet binaries must be installed into
# secure locations only alterable by the "root" user.
# - lima: shared
#   # MAC address of the instance; lima will pick one based on the instance name,
#   # so DHCP assigned ip addresses should remain constant over instance restarts.
#   macAddress: ""
#   # Interface name, defaults to "lima0", "lima1", etc.
#   interface: ""
#
# Lima can also connect to "unmanaged" vde networks addressed by "vnl". This
# means that the daemons will not be controlled by Lima, but must be started
# before the instance.  The interface type (host, shared, or bridged) is
# configured in vde_vmnet and not in lima.
# vnl (virtual network locator) points to the vde_switch socket directory,
# optionally with vde:// prefix
# - vnl: "vde:///var/run/vde.ctl"
#   # VDE Switch port number (not TCP/UDP port number). Set to 65535 for PTP mode.

# Port forwarding rules. Forwarding between ports 22 and ssh.localPort cannot be overridden.
# Rules are checked sequentially until the first one matches.
# portForwards:
# - guestPort: 443
#   hostIP: "0.0.0.0" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"; allows privileged port forwarding
# # default: hostPort: 443 (same as guestPort)
# # default: guestIP: "127.0.0.1" (also matches bind addresses "0.0.0.0", "::", and "::1")
# # default: proto: "tcp" (only valid value right now)
#
# - guestPortRange: [4000, 4999]
#   hostIP:  "0.0.0.0" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
# # default: hostPortRange: [4000, 4999] (must specify same number of ports as guestPortRange)
#
# - guestPort: 80
#   hostPort: 8080 # overrides the default value 80
#
# - guestIP: "127.0.0.2" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
#   hostIP: "127.0.0.2" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
# # default: guestPortRange: [1, 65535]
# # default: hostPortRange: [1, 65535]
#
# - guestPort: 8888
#   ignore: true (don't forward this port)
#
# - guestSocket: "/run/user/{{.UID}}/my.sock"
#   hostSocket: mysocket
# # "guestSocket" can include these template variables: {{.Home}}, {{.UID}}, and {{.User}}.
# # "hostSocket" can include {{.Home}}, {{.Dir}}, {{.Name}}, {{.UID}}, and {{.User}}.
# # Put sockets into "{{.Dir}}/sock" to avoid collision with Lima internal sockets!
# # Sockets can also be forwarded to ports and vice versa, but not to/from a range of ports.
# # Forwarding requires the lima user to have rw access to the "guestsocket",
# # and the local user rwx access to the directory of the "hostsocket".
#
# # Lima internally appends this fallback rule at the end:
# - guestIP: "127.0.0.1"
#   guestPortRange: [1, 65535]
#   hostIP: "127.0.0.1"
#   hostPortRange: [1, 65535]
# # Any port still not matched by a rule will not be forwarded (ignored)

# Message. Information to be shown to the user, given as a Go template for the instance.
# The same template variables as for listing instances can be used, for example {{.Dir}}.
# You can view the complete list of variables using `limactl list --list-fields` command.
# It also includes {{.HostOS}} and {{.HostArch}} vars, for the runtime GOOS and GOARCH.
# message: |
#   This will be shown to the user.

# Extra environment variables that will be loaded into the VM at start up.
# These variables are consumed by internal init scripts, and also added
# to /etc/environment.
# If you set any of "ftp_proxy", "http_proxy", "https_proxy", or "no_proxy", then
# Lima will automatically set an uppercase variant to the same value as well.
# env:
#   KEY: value

# Lima will override the proxy environment variables with values from the current process
# environment (the environment in effect when you run `limactl start`). It will automatically
# replace the strings "localhost" and "127.0.0.1" with the host gateway address from inside
# the VM, so it stays routable. Use of the process environment can be disabled by setting
# propagateProxyEnv to false.
# Default: true
propagateProxyEnv: null

# The host agent implements a DNS server that looks up host names on the host
# using the local system resolver. This means changing VPN and network settings
# are reflected automatically into the guest, including conditional forward,
# and mDNS lookup. By default only IPv4 addresses will be returned. IPv6 addresses
# can only work when using a vmnet network interface and the host has working
# IPv6 configured as well.
hostResolver:
  # Default: true
  enabled: null
  # Default: false
  ipv6: null

# If useHostResolver is false, then the following rules apply for configuring dns:
# Explicitly set DNS addresses for qemu user-mode networking. By default qemu picks *one*
# nameserver from the host config and forwards all queries to this server. On macOS
# Lima adds the nameservers configured for the "en0" interface to the list. In case this
# still doesn't work (e.g. VPN setups), the servers can be specified here explicitly.
# If nameservers are specified here, then the "en0" configuration will be ignored.
# dns:
# - 1.1.1.1
# - 1.0.0.1

# ===================================================================== #
# GLOBAL DEFAULTS AND OVERRIDES
# ===================================================================== #

# The builtin defaults can be changed globally by creating a $LIMA_HOME/_config/default.yaml
# file. It will be used by ALL instances under the same $LIMA_HOME, and it
# will be applied on each `limactl start`, so can affect instance restarts.

# A similar mechanism is $LIMA_HOME/_config/override.yaml, which will take
# precedence even over the settings in an instances lima.yaml file.
# It too applies to ALL instances under the same $LIMA_HOME, and is applied
# on each restart. It can be used to globally override settings, e.g. make
# the mount of the home directory writable.

# On each instance start the config settings are determined: If a value is
# not set in `lima.yaml`, then the `default.yaml` is used. If that file
# doesn't exist, or the value is not defined in the file, then the buildin
# default is used. If `override.yaml` exists and defines the value, then
# it overrides whatever has been choosen so far.

# For slices (e.g. `mounts`, `provision`) and maps (`env`) the entries are
# combined instead of replacing each other. Slices are produced from override
# settings, followed by lima.yaml, followed by defaults.yaml (but NOT from
# builtin defaults). Maps are produced starting with defaults.yaml values,
# overwriting with lima.yaml ones, overwriting with override.yaml.

# Exceptions:
# - `dns` will use the list from the highest priority file; they are not
#   combined. If override.yaml defines a list of `dns` entries, then the
#   settings in default.yaml and lima.yaml are ignored.
#
# - `mounts` will update the `writable` setting when 2 entries have the
#   same `location` value. For this reason they are processed in the opposite
#   order: starting with default, followed by lima, and then override.
#
# -`networks` will replace lower priority entries with the same `interface`
#   name with higher priority definitions. This does not apply if the
#  `interface` field is empty. `networks` are therefore also processed
#  in lowest to highest priority order.
