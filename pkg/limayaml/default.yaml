  # https://github.com/AkihiroSuda/vde_vmnet. Both vde_switch and vde_vmnet
  # daemons must be running before the instance is started. The interface type

# Port forwarding rules. Forwarding between ports 22 and ssh.localPort cannot be overridden.

# portForwards:

#   # default: hostPort: 443 (same as guestPort)
#   # default: guestIP: "127.0.0.1" (also matches bind addresses "0.0.0.0", "::", and "::1")
#   # default: proto: "tcp" (only valid value right now)
#   - guestPortRange: [4000, 4999]
#     hostIP:  "0.0.0.0" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
#   # default: hostPortRange: [4000, 4999] (must specify same number of ports as guestPortRange)
#   - guestPort: 80
#     hostPort: 8080 # overrides the default value 80
#   - guestIP: "127.0.0.2" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
