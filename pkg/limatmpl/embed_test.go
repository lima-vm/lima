// Notes:
// * When the template starts with "#" then the comparison will be textual instead of structural.
//   This is required to verify comment handling.
// * If the description starts with "TODO" then the test is expected to fail (until it is fixed).
// * If the description starts with "ERROR" then the test is expected to fail with an error containing the expected string.
// * base is split on "---\n" and stored as base0.yaml, base1.yaml, ... in the same dir as the template.
// * If any base template starts with "#!" then the extension will be .sh instead of .yaml.
// * The template is automatically prefixed with "base: base0.yaml" unless base0 is a script.
// * All line comments will be separated by 2 spaces from the value on output.
// * Merge order of additionalDisks, mounts, and networks depends on the logic in the
//   combineListEntries() functions and will not follow the order of the base template(s).
